<p>Hello, my name is Swarnika Suman and my current age, in the year 2020, is between 10 to 11 years and I study in St. Michaels High School. I love singing, dancing, drawing and...... as you may guess watching cartoons! :) . Specialy the one that is the favourite cartoon of everyone and my too <b><i>Shinchan</i></b> I can't spend even a day without watching it. If you are the one that dosn't know much about Shinchan let me tell you........Shinchan is a 5 year old boy living with his family and friends in a small town called Kasukabe in Japan. He is very different from other children - He is very wiered but funny.the picture in the background is his image only.My favourit food is not one particular one but many like ice-cream, gol-gappe, chaat, cutlets etc.</p>
